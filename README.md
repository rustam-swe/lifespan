## How It Works: Work Time Calculation

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the "Work Time" statistics are calculated:

### 1. Declaring Variables
   - **Work Days**: We assume an average of 5 workdays per week.
   - **Work Weeks**: People work 50 weeks per year (excluding weekends and holidays).
   - **Daily Work Hours by Age**:
     - Ages 18â€“24: 4 hours/day (due to study commitments).
     - Ages 25â€“54: 8 hours/day.
     - Ages 55â€“65: 7 hours/day.
     - Ages 65â€“75: 5 hours/day.

### 2. Year-Based Calculation
   - Annual work days = 5 workdays/week Ã— 50 weeks/year = 250 days.
   - For each age period, multiply the annual work days by the daily work hours and the number of years in that period.
   - Add the results for all periods up to the userâ€™s current age.

### 3. Including Odd Months and Days
   - To improve precision, we account for remaining months and days:
     - Odd months are converted to days (annual work days Ã· 12 Ã— months).
     - Add remaining days from the year and month.
     - Multiply the total odd days by the daily work hours for the current age period.

### 4. Final Results
   - **Total Work Time**: Sum of hours from year-based and odd days calculations.
   - **Average Work Time**: Total work hours divided by the userâ€™s age.
   - **Remaining Work Time**: Subtract total work hours from the average lifespan work hours (calculated for 75 years).

### 5. Edge Cases
   - If the user is over 75 years old, a congratulatory message is shown instead of remaining work time.

### 6. Data Sources
   - [Bureau of Labor Statistics: American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/charts/american-time-use/activity-by-age.htm)
   - [Our World in Data: Time Use](https://ourworldindata.org/time-use)
